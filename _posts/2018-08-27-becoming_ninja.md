Some time ago a friend showed me Talos Intelligence Group's blog post [How do I become a Ninja?](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2009/07/how-do-i-become-ninja.html). It's a great reference if you are already familiar with exploitation basics, but if you're just getting started, it doesn't provide much in the way of direction, which can be super frustrating for someone looking to learn.


When I first read it, one bullet jumped out at me:

> The main thing with technical skills is you don't need to be a master of any of them, you need to be a master of recalling where the information you need is located.

I've lost count of the hours I've wasted trying to dig up the solution to a problem I've solved before. I wanted to put all my lessons learned in one spot and at the same time provide a resource for those looking to learn how software gets exploited.

You can find my walkthroughs of their recommended training [here]( {{ site.url  }}/exdev).
