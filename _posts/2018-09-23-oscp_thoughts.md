About six months back I took my first stab at earning my Offensive Security Certified Professional certification, or OSCP. I failed hard on my first go, and as I prepare to take the exam again I wanted to document some lessons learned from my first attempt.

Offensive Security's training program is [Penetration Testing with Kali](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/) which offers a lab environment of 50 machines for you to exploit. It is undoubtedly one of the most challenging goals I've pursued, and its also been one of the most rewarding. Even after failing my first try on the exam, the lessons I learned in the labs paid dividends immediately. OSCP focuses on getting hands on with the material. You have to be able to demonstrate the ability to compromise computers in order to pass, and successfully passing is a strong indicator of your ability to adapt to new environments and solve unfamiliar problems in a short period of time.

## Sign Up

One of OSCPs bonuses as a certification is its good for life. Pass the exam, and you're certified. No maintenance fees. No membership fees. No re-certification. The value for getting certified is unmatched. 30 days of lab time costs, $800, which *includes* the cost of the exam. The 60 and 90 day options, as well as the lab extensions, are also all reasonably priced, making it relatively accessible to pay out of pocket. In comparison, other week long training programs can start around 3 to $5,000. And if you fail and want to take the exam again, the test itself only costs $60 to retake.

To take OSCP, you must sign up for PWK, and should expect about two weeks to a month from signing up to being able to start. The labs only allow a certain number of people to be active at a time, so you won't be able to start immediately after signing up. The wait time for starting doesn't apply if you're extending your lab time. You can start almost immediately after you extend your time.

You can also only sign up with an email account from a domain owned by you or someone you work for (eg company or university email), so keep that in mind if you don't have a work or school email you can easily use, you'll have to set up your own domain.
