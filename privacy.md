## Google Analytics

I use a tool called [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) to collect information about use of my site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit my site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to my site. I use the information I get from Google Analytics to track outreach and make site improvements. I track usage with Google Analytics' `gtag.js`. This sets a cookie on your computer called "_ga," which is used to distinguish unique users. This cookie consists of four fields, none of which contain and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You can read more about these fields in the answer to [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16102436/what-are-the-values-in-ga-cookie) on Stack Overflow.

While Google Analytics does collect User IP addresses, I have set up my Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses. Google explains how they do this [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en). The IP address Google collects is the address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. I do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Additionally, Google Analytics does not allow me to view user's IP addresses, as they explain [here](https://www.analyticscourse.net/ip-tracking-google-analytics/). While Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Googleâ€™s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You can prevent Google Analytics from tracking you by using their [Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
