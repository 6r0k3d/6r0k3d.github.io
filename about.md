Understanding through doing

Interested in learning about computer security? You've come to the right place.

Demand for those with the skills necessary to secure an organization's systems is at an all time high. This site aims to provide the reader with a working understanding of what it takes to do that.

There are tons of existing resources that seek to do just that. So why add one more to the mix? A few reasons:

- Frustration. I've worked through a lot of guides and walkthroughs. Most make assumptions about either the reader's skill level or their environment that leads to things not working properly. My goal is to lay everything out so readers can easily follow along.

- You learn best through teaching. This site serves as a way to build my own understanding of the concepts discussed, and as a reference to come back to.

- I hope for this site to be a crucible for ideas, discussing what works and what doesn't. By sharing these lessons learned, this site looks to give those with the desire the skills to succeed.

This site was built using Jekyll and is hosted by Github Pages. You can read about my experiences setting it up [here]({{ site.url }}/webdev), or visit [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for more details.
